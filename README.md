# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
This project is part of Udacity nondegree  program

Program Outline
1. Using Time Module to compute program runtime
2. Geting program Inputs from the user, Using command line arguments
3. Creating Pet Images Labels, Using the pet images filenames
4. Store the pet image labels in a data structure [dictionary]
5. Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
6. Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
7. Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
8. Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
9. Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
10. Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
11. Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
12. Calculate the Results
13. Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
14. Print the Results
